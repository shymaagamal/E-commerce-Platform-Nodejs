# Online Bookstore (E-commerce Platform) - MEAN Stack Project

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-life e-commerce platform where users can browse books, add them to a cart, and place orders. It covers all the topics taught in the course and introduces additional concepts for students to research independently.

## Project Features

### Backend (Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB)
1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - Users can register, log in, and log out.
   - Use JWT for authentication and authorization.
   - Implement role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. regular user).

2. **RESTful API Design**
   - Design RESTful endpoints for:
     - User management (register, login, profile update).
     - Book management (CRUD operations for books, accessible only to admins).
     - Cart management (add/remove books, view cart).
     - Order management (place orders, view order history).
     - Review management (submit, view, update, delete reviews).

3. **Database Design**
   - Use Mongoose to define schemas and models for:
     - Users (name, email, password, role).
     - Books (title, author, price, description, stock, reviews, image(url or name)).
     - Orders (user, books, total price, status).
     - Reviews (user, book, rating, review, createdAt).
   - ERD Required

4. **Middleware**
   - Implement custom middleware for:
     - Authentication (verify JWT).
     - Error handling (centralized error handling middleware).
     - Logging (log requests to a file using `fs` or a logging library like `winston`).

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Use `bcrypt.js` to hash passwords before saving them to the database.
   - Implement pagination and filtering for the book list API.
   - Use transactions to handle order placement (e.g., reduce book stock and create an order in a single transaction).

6. **File Handling**
   - Allow admins to upload book covers using `multer` (research required) or online CDN.
   - Serve static files (e.g., book covers) using Express.

7. **Validation**
   - Use Mongoose validations for:
     - User input (e.g., email format, password strength).
     - Book data (e.g., price must be positive, stock must be an integer).
     - Review data (e.g., rating must be between 1 and 5, review text must not exceed 500 characters).

   - Use Schema validation like (Joi, Ajv, etc...)

---

## General Remarks
  - Any pagination needs to be server-side pagination.
  - Good UI.
  - Think about model relations.
  - Think about what needs to be indexed in your models.
  - Use github, show the world.
  - Deploy your work to the web. (Use heroku and atlas).
  - Share your work on Linkedin, brand yourself.
  - Lint your projects.

## BONUS
  - Use idP. (register, login with google and Facebook).
  - In-App Notification.

---

## Additional Features for Research
1. **Payment Integration**
   - Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to handle payments during checkout.
   - Research how to securely handle payment information.

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email notifications to users when they register, place an order, or when their order status changes.
   - Use a library like `nodemailer` for sending emails.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Vercel).
   - Research how to configure environment variables for production.

4. **Caching**
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., book list) using Redis or in-memory caching.

5. **WebSockets**
   - Use WebSockets to implement real-time features (e.g., notify admins when a new order is placed).

## Project Deliverables
1. **Backend**
   - A fully functional RESTful API with proper documentation (e.g., using, postman collection or bruno collection).
   - Proper error handling and validation.
   - Git repository with clear commit history. (make sure every commit has a clear message, everyones should contribute to the project)

2. **Frontend**
   - A responsive and user-friendly Angular application.
   - Proper state management (e.g., using Angular services or NgRx).
   - Git repository with clear commit history. (make sure every commit has a clear message, everyones should contribute to the project)

3. **Documentation**
   - A README file explaining how to set up and run the project.
 4. **Presentation**
   - A presentation demonstrating the project features and discussing the technologies used.
   - A demo of the application with a walkthrough of the codebase.
